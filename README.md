Title:Fixed Deposit Subscription Analysis & Prediction.

Description: Fixed Deposit Subscription project aims to explore and understand the factors contributing to predict the subscription of fixed deposit. By leveraging the power of data analysis & predictive modelling, this analysis will provide valuable insights to help business by converting more customer for fixed deposit subscription, improve marketing strategy, and ultimately drive business growth.

In this project, I used a historical fixed deposit subscription dataset that includes various features such as age, job, marital status, education, loan defaulter status, housing loan information, and previous interactions. The goal of the project is to identify the factors that contribute to the prediction of fixed deposit subscription.

During the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) process, I employed various techniques to visualize and analyze the data. This involved examining the distribution of variables, identifying patterns, exploring relationships between different features, and detecting any outliers or missing values. EDA helped me gain a comprehensive understanding of the dataset and uncover insights that could be relevant for predicting fixed deposit subscription.

For the machine learning part of the project, I utilized different techniques to develop a predictive model. This involved training the model using the available data and employing algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests. These algorithms allowed me to learn the patterns and relationships within the data and make predictions on whether a customer would subscribe to a fixed deposit or not.

By combining EDA and machine learning techniques, I was able to gain insights into the factors influencing fixed deposit subscription. The project aimed to provide a comprehensive understanding of customer behavior and enable better decision-making related to marketing strategies, customer targeting, and product offerings in the context of fixed deposits.

To address this business issue i have solved this quries :
1.How accurately can we predict the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit?
2.Which customer attributes and campaign-related factors are most influential in predicting the likelihood of a customer subscribing to a term deposit?
3.How can the bank optimize its marketing strategies to increase the conversion rates for term deposits?
